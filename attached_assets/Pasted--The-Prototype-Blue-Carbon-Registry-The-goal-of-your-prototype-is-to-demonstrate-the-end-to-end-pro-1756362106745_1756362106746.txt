 The Prototype: Blue Carbon Registry
The goal of your prototype is to demonstrate the end-to-end process: from a blue carbon project's data being collected to a company retiring a carbon credit.

The "Flow" for the Demo:

Project Registration: A user (the "Project Developer") can register a new blue carbon project (e.g., a mangrove restoration in coastal India) on a web app.

Data Input: You will show how data from "sensors" and "satellite imagery" is fed into the system.

Automatic Verification: The platform uses a smart contract to verify the data against predefined rules.

Credit Issuance: If verified, a unique carbon credit token is automatically "minted" and sent to the Project Developer's wallet.

Marketplace: A "Buyer" (e.g., a tech company) can browse and purchase these tokens.

Retirement: The buyer "retires" the token on the blockchain to claim the carbon offset, and this action is permanently recorded.

üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack
Your prototype should combine a frontend, a backend, and a blockchain layer to show a compelling, end-to-end solution.

Frontend (The Dashboard):

Technology: React.js or Vue.js. These are great for building a dynamic, user-friendly interface.

What to show:

A project dashboard showing a map of the blue carbon project's location.

Live data feeds (simulated) from the IoT sensors (e.g., CO2 levels, soil moisture).

A visually appealing graph showing the carbon sequestration progress over time.

A wallet view showing the number of carbon credits a project developer or buyer holds.

A transaction history that links to a blockchain explorer.

Backend (The Connector):

Technology: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Flask/Django.

What it does: This layer will act as the bridge. It will take data from your simulated datasets and send it to the blockchain via a smart contract. It will also serve the data to the frontend for the dashboard.

Blockchain (The Trust Layer):

Technology: Ethereum (for a public, transparent solution) or Polygon (for lower fees and faster transactions). For a hackathon, a public blockchain is more appealing because it demonstrates true decentralization.

What to deploy: A Smart Contract (written in Solidity). This is the core of your project.

Registry Function: To register new projects and assign unique IDs.

MRV Logic: A function that receives data and checks if it meets the criteria for issuing a new credit.

Token Minting Function: A function that creates a new carbon credit token (ERC-20 standard) and sends it to the project owner's wallet.

Retirement Function: A function that permanently "burns" or retires a token, recording the offset.

Data & Datasets (The "Realism"):

IoT Data (Simulated): You don't need real sensors. You can create a simple dataset in a JSON or CSV file. Include mock data for:

timestamp: The time the reading was taken.

co2_level: A value representing CO2 sequestration.

biomass_growth: A value representing the growth of the vegetation.

location_id: A unique ID for the project area.

Satellite Imagery: You can't use live satellite feeds, but you can use real images to make your prototype look professional.

Find publicly available satellite imagery of mangrove forests from a source like Google Earth Engine or Copernicus Open Access Hub.

Use before-and-after images of a degraded area and a restored area to visually represent the project's success on your dashboard.
